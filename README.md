### 🧠 About Me

Engineer by training, developer by passion. I hold a **Master’s in Mechatronics Engineering**, and I specialize in building **robust, scalable systems** at the intersection of **IoT, robotics, and cloud-native platforms**. My work ranges from writing **ROS-based robotics software in Python**, to designing **backend microservices** in Java, and building **responsive frontends** in React.

I thrive when solving hard problems that involve **multiple domains**—hardware protocols, backend logic, DevOps, and user experience.
